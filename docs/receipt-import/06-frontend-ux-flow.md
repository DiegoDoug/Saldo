# Receipt Import — Document 6: Frontend UX Flow

**Status:** Complete — builds on Documents 1–5.

---

## 1. Entry point

No FAB and no CSV import exist to place this "next to" (Document 1 §2) — the brief's framing describes a target IA, not today's UI. The concrete, low-risk placement: a second header button next to the existing "+ Nuevo" toggle on `TransactionsPage.tsx` (`frontend/src/modules/transactions/TransactionsPage.tsx:52-58`), labeled "Escanear recibo." Same visual weight, same location users already look to add a transaction, zero new navigation infrastructure. Disabled (with a tooltip, "Requiere conexión") when `navigator.onLine` is false or when the backend reports the feature unconfigured (Document 5 §2) — the one place in the app that needs an explicit online-only affordance, everything else being offline-tolerant by design.

A second discoverability entry in `AppNav`'s "Dinero" popover group is a reasonable v1.1 addition, not required for launch — the transactions page is where every version of this flow ends up regardless of where it started.

## 2. The dialog: a state machine, not a route

Reuses `ForgotPasswordDialog.tsx`'s exact shell (`fixed inset-0 z-50 grid place-items-center bg-ink/40`, click-outside/Escape to close, `role="dialog" aria-modal="true"`) and its internal state-machine pattern (`step === "form" ? <X/> : <Y/>`), extended to four steps instead of two:

```
capture → uploading → reviewing → done
   │           │            │
   └─ pick/take photo   └─ AI failed → error state, retry or discard
```

No new route (`/receipts/...`) — matches the existing precedent that `ForgotPasswordDialog` is a dialog, not a page, and avoids adding routing infra for a flow that's fundamentally a modal overlay on the transactions list the user is already looking at.

### Step 1 — capture
`ReceiptDropZone.tsx`: `<input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="environment">` for mobile camera capture, plus drag-and-drop for desktop. This is the first file-input in the app (Document 1 §2) — kept intentionally minimal: one file, client-side size/type pre-check (mirroring the backend's limits so the user gets instant feedback instead of a round-trip 413) before upload.

### Step 2 — uploading / processing
`api.ts` gains the first `FormData`-based call in the codebase (the existing `apiRequest` helper only does JSON/urlencoded bodies — a small, additive `apiUploadRequest` variant, not a rewrite). On success (`202`), `hooks.ts`'s `useReceiptImport()` switches to `useQuery({ queryKey: ["receiptImport", id], refetchInterval: (data) => data?.status === "processing" ? 1500 : false })` — the first polling `useQuery` in the app, but an idiomatic one given TanStack Query is already wired and otherwise idle (Document 1 §1). UI shows a spinner over the captured image thumbnail with a short rotating status line ("Leyendo el recibo…" → "Buscando comercio…" is out of scope for v1 — a single "Analizando…" message is enough; the backend doesn't expose sub-step granularity and shouldn't need to).

### Step 3 — review
`ReceiptReviewForm.tsx` reuses `AddTransactionForm`'s field set and layout (amount, currency, date, account select, category select, merchant select, notes, tags) rather than inventing a parallel form — prefilled from `DraftReceiptAnalysis`. Three additions beyond the existing form:

- **Confidence badges.** Any field with `confidence < SALDO_RECEIPT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` (a small, amber "revisar" badge next to the field label) — purely visual emphasis, never a blocker; the user is always free to confirm regardless (Phase 6/7's "human is always the final gate"). `amount` and `date` use a stricter threshold (0.9) than other fields since they're the two most consequential to get wrong in a personal-finance ledger.
- **Inline merchant/category creation.** Today, the transaction form's merchant/category are plain `<select>`s with no "create new" affordance (Document 1 §3) — a receipt scan of an unrecognized merchant needs one. Generalizes `TagInput`'s create-on-type combobox pattern (already in the codebase for tags) to merchant and category selects: typing a name that doesn't match shows a "Crear `<name>`" option, which on selection calls the existing `POST /merchants` or `POST /budgeting/categories` endpoint immediately (not deferred to confirm) so the newly-created id is available like any other option for the rest of the review.
- **`account_id` is always required and never AI-suggested** — a receipt has no signal for which of the user's accounts paid, so this is the one field the form always makes the user pick explicitly, exactly as `AddTransactionForm` already requires today.
- A dismissible warnings banner surfaces `DraftReceiptAnalysis.warnings` verbatim (e.g. "El texto del recibo estaba borroso") above the form.

Account for the account/merchant/category "created via API but not yet in local Dexie" gap: after a successful `POST /merchants` or `POST /budgeting/categories`, the frontend also writes the row into the local Dexie table directly (`merchants/localRepo.ts` / `budgeting`'s category repo already expose the primitives for this) so it's usable immediately without waiting on the next `/sync/pull` — symmetric with how the eventual transaction write works.

### Step 4 — confirm
On "Confirmar": `addTransaction(...)` (existing `transactions/localRepo.ts`, unmodified) writes to Dexie exactly as manual entry does, using the client-generated transaction id; then `POST /receipt-imports/{id}/confirm` sends that id to the backend (Document 3) purely for receipt-history linking. Dialog shows a brief success state (mirrors `ForgotPasswordDialog`'s `ConfirmationView`) and closes; the sync engine picks up the new rows on its next push exactly like a manually entered transaction — no special-casing anywhere in the sync path.

"Descartar" is available at every step (`capture`/`reviewing`/error) and calls `DELETE /receipt-imports/{id}` if a receipt row already exists.

## 3. Error handling

- Upload rejected (bad type/too large): inline error on the drop-zone, no dialog step change.
- Feature disabled (`503`): the "Escanear recibo" button doesn't render at all rather than opening a dialog that immediately errors (checked once via a small capabilities flag alongside the existing app-boot config fetch, not a new endpoint — Document 5 §2's `deepseek_enabled` can ride on the same settings surface the frontend already reads at boot, e.g. `GET /health` or a comparable existing check; if no such endpoint exists yet, this is a one-field addition to whichever boot-time config call already exists, not a new one).
- Pipeline failure (`status="failed"`): review step shows `error_message` and two actions — "Reintentar" (re-upload the same image, since content-hash dedup means this doesn't create clutter) or "Descartar."
- Duplicate detected on upload (`duplicate_of` set): a small confirmation ("Ya importaste este recibo el [date] — ¿continuar de todos modos?") before proceeding, rather than silently reprocessing or silently blocking.

## 4. What's deliberately out of scope for v1's UX

- No dedicated `/receipts` history page — `GET /receipt-imports` (Document 3) exists for the API to be ready, but a browsing UI is a natural, separable v1.1 addition once the core scan→confirm loop is validated with real users.
- No multi-page capture UI, even though the OCR interface already supports it (Document 2 §7) — v1 is one photo, one receipt.
- No zod/react-hook-form migration for this form specifically — it follows the existing hand-rolled `useState` convention to stay consistent with `AddTransactionForm`, even though Document 1 flagged this as a place the convention will eventually strain. Worth a standalone follow-up rather than mixing a forms-library migration into this feature's first PR.
